 MODULE intList
 USE stepPotentials
!
! Purpose:
! This module contains the derived-type data structure to keep interaction information.
! Non bonded interactions are computed only within a distance of the particle i. This
! is periodically updated.
! Within that distance you can find particles that possibly will collide with particle i.
! Between this particles and i, interaction data is computed and stored in the intpList
! derived data type.
! You keep in this data type:
! number of particle that will interact with i (1-natom) in patnum
! number of particle interacting seen from other particle (j) (1-nblist(j)%nats) in simp
! type of sq well interaction in stepPt
! ???? in xsum
! time of the shortest interaction (timp), kin energy transfer in (deltak)
